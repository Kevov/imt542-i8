# imt542_i8
Since I have already fetched data from my chosen information source in I7. I will be creating an extra endpoint which will query [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and demonstrate that in the video.
## Files
main.py - Where the main routes are coded
test.py - Where the calls to Ngrok are made

## Endpoints

/gamelist - fetches a game list from Steam
/ditto - fetches info for the pokemon ditto [THIS IS THE EXTRA ENDPOINT FOR I8]
/whatisthis - a test endpoint

## Video
